# Compare the Kenna Risk Score of CISA Exploited Vulnerabilities

The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency's [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) has quickly become an indispensable tool for security researchers and practicioners. This script will pull the current list of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, then query the Kenna API to gather the Kenna Risk Score for each CVE, as well as some other useful data points which will assist in evaluating each CVE. The script will take a few minutes to generate the output CSV, so please grab a coffee after executing the command to run the script.

The Kenna API token and its associated Kenna account **must** have current access to the [Kenna VI+](https://www.kennasecurity.com/products/viplus/) API.
