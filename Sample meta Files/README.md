# Meta Files Repository
The Cisco Vulnerability Management platform is able to ingest data from any strucutured dataset in CSV format into the platform. it uses a converter utility to transform such data into a JSON file in a specified format that can allow customers to import asset and vulnerabilities data into the platform. A meta file is needed for this conversion and needs to be done one time for each data set being ingested. 

This directory is created to serve as a repository where customers can have access to files that may have been created for various scanning platforms. While care has been made to present these files in a way that can be used as is where applicable, customers may need to make tweaks in order to match data from their environment or their particular use case.
