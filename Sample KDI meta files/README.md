# Meta Files Repository
The Cisco Vulnerability Management platform is capable of ingesting data from any structured dataset in CSV format. It utilizes a converter utility to transform this data into a JSON file, formatted specifically to enable customers to import asset and vulnerability data into the platform. A meta file is needed for this conversion and needs to be done once for each data set being ingested. 

The purpose of this directory is to act as a repository, providing customers with access to conversion files that have been developed for various scanning platforms. Although these files are designed to be used directly where possible, some customers may find that adjustments are necessary to align with the particulars of their environment or their unique use case.
