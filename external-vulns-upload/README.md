# Kenna External Vuln uploader API script

This script will upload vulnerabilities to Kenna. Vulnerabilities must be designated with a CVE, CWE or WASC identifier.
Extra data may be included as custom field data or merged into the Kenna notes field using meta files as displayed
in the included sample files.

Usage:

```
kenna-external-vulns-upload.rb <Kenna API token> <CSV file of vulns> <CSV file with custom field ids> <primary locator type> <primary locator column> 
<vulnerability type> <vulnerability column> <CVS file with columns for notes field> <preferred case for hostname><last seen column> <first found column> 
<due date column> <status column> <scanner vuln identifier column>
```

Parameters:
- data_file = CSV of vulnerability data to be uploaded into Kenna
- custom_field_meta = CSV of column names in data and what custom field to put them in 
- primary_locator = static string either hostname or ip_address or url or application
- locator_column = column in csv that has primary locator info (actual ip, hostname or url)
